 Hey Anusha,

Just wanted to take a moment to remind you how amazing you are. Your kindness, strength, and the way you light up any room with your presence—it’s truly inspiring. Life feels a little brighter with you in it, and I’m so grateful to call you my friend.

Whether it’s your laugh, your wisdom, or the way you always show up for the people you care about, you have a way of making the world feel more beautiful just by being yourself. Never doubt your worth, your magic, or the impact you have on those around you.

Stay golden, always.

With love and gratitude,
Abhra
